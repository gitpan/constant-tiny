NAME

    constant::tiny - Perl pragma to declare constants


DESCRIPTION

    This module is a lightweight version of Perl standard "constant.pm".
    Here are the keys differences:

    *   only works on Perl 5.10+ in order to simplify a good part of the
        code

    *   doesn't support Unicode name; please use the standard "constant.pm"
        module if you need to create constants with Unicode names

    *   stricter rules about valid names; standard "constant.pm" gives more
        detailled diagnostics about why a given name is not valid

    The rationale behind this module is that recent versions of
    "constant.pm" have a better support for Unicode names. However, this
    means loading full Unicode support (utf8_heavy.pl) which consumes
    memory. In most cases, the difference is not problematic. But in some
    particular cases (embedded Perl, frequently forked programs a la CGI),
    the increased memory cost can become a concern. This is even more
    annoying if the program doesn't use Unicode at all and therefore pays
    the high price.

    Hence this module, which provides a very simple solution, only requiring
    you to add "use constant::tiny" before any declaration of constants.

    Other than this, the usage is (nearly) exactly the same as with the
    standard "constant.pm" module. For more details, please read constant.
